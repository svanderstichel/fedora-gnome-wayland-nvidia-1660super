#**Solution to performances issues on fedora41-gnome-wayland-nvidia-1660super**

I'm a new linux user myself, this is the second time trying to leave windows and **fedora has been best choice**.

I have been struggling with performance issues on desktop: Laggy animations, weird effects on firefox and so on.

However, thanks to the information available in fedora reddit i was able to find a solution for my specs.

I have made available this bash script for everyone who needs it.

Any other contribution for improving performance on nvidia is welcome :)
